# defaults.sh — internal values that are NOT exposed as action inputs (yet).

# This file is the single source of truth for pipeline-controlled settings.
# Scripts must read these values as ${SBOMIT_<NAME>:-$DEFAULT_<NAME>}, so that
# promoting one to an action input later only requires adding the input in
# action.yml and mapping it to the matching SBOMIT_<NAME> env var.
#
# User-facing input defaults (language, sbom-format, ...) live in action.yml,
# not here, to avoid two sources of truth.

# Tool install settings (versions, sources) are NOT here. Each tool keeps its
